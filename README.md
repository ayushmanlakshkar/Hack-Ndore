# Water Supply Management | Hack'ndore ## Problem Statement
Indore relies on the Narmada River for water but lacks infrastructure to monitor household-level distribu􏰀on. This gap leads to inefficiencies and poten􏰀al wastage. The advanced system aims to op􏰀mize water supply management using cu􏰁ng-edge technologies for efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. Key features include:
- Monitoring Systems: Digital and physical systems to measure water received by each household. - Data Collec􏰀on and Analysis: Con􏰀nuous data collec􏰀on for detailed analysis and repor􏰀ng.
- Repor􏰀ng and Management: Monthly and yearly reports to iden􏰀fy trends and inefficiencies.
- Equitable Distribu􏰀on: Ensuring fair water distribu􏰀on across households.
- Leakage Detec􏰀on: Iden􏰀fying and addressing poten􏰀al leakages in the distribu􏰀on network. ## Approach
## Overview
The Smart Water Management System for Indore aims to op􏰀mize water distribu􏰀on, minimize wastage, and enhance overall water resource management using cu􏰁ng-edge IoT and AI/ML technologies.
<img align="center" alt="flowchart" width="1000" height ="600" src="flow.jpeg"> ## Key Features
### IoT Devices and Water Supply Meters:
1. Install IoT-enabled water supply meters in average households to measure water consump􏰀on.
2. Use low-power, long-range communica􏰀on technologies like LoRaWAN or NB-IoT for data transmission.
### Data Processing and Cloud Storage:
1. Transmit collected data to a central server.

2. U􏰀lize cloud services for scalable data management and analysis. ### AI/ML Analysis:
1. Analyze water usage pa􏰂erns to detect anomalies, predict leaks, and op􏰀mize distribu􏰀on.
2. Iden􏰀fy areas prone to high water usage and make predic􏰀ons based on weather pa􏰂erns and other factors.
### React-based Dashboard:
1. Real-􏰀me monitoring and detailed repor􏰀ng for residents and municipal staff.
2. Alerts for leaks and other anomalies.
3. Visualiza􏰀on tools to display consump􏰀on trends, distribu􏰀on metrics, and user complaints.
## Ge􏰁ng Started
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a React and PostgreSQL-based project on your local machine.
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn - PostgreSQL - Git
- Python
### Se􏰁ng Up PostgreSQL 1. **Install PostgreSQL**:

Follow the instruc􏰀ons for your opera􏰀ng system from the [official PostgreSQL website](h􏰂ps://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. **Create a Database**:
Open your PostgreSQL client (psql, pgAdmin, etc.) and run the following commands:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE water_management;
CREATE USER wm_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'wm_password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE water_management TO wm_user;
## Set Up Tables:
Connect to your database and create the necessary tables Exampler Tables:
```sql
\c water_management CREATE TABLE water_usage (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, household_id INT,
zone VARCHAR(50), water_used NUMERIC, usage_date DATE
);
CREATE TABLE households ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, locality VARCHAR(100), household_size INT

);
## Se􏰁ng Up the Backend
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone h􏰂ps://github.com/yourusername/smart-water-management.git cd smart-water-management/backend
2. Install Dependencies: ```bash
npm install
3. Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content: ```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=wm_user
DB_PASSWORD=wm_password
DB_NAME=water_management
4. Run the Backend Server: ```bash
npm start
## Usage
- Access the Dashboard: Open your browser and navigate to h􏰂p://localhost:3000 to access the React-based dashboard.
- API Endpoints: The backend API will be available at h􏰂p://localhost:5000.
## Conclusion
By following this guide, you will have a local instance of the Smart Water Management System for Indore, featuring a React-based dashboard and a PostgreSQL backend. This system leverages IoT and

AI/ML technologies to ensure efficient water distribu􏰀on, minimize wastage, and enhance the overall management of water resources in the city.
```
This README provides a comprehensive guide for se􏰁ng up the project locally, including se􏰁ng up PostgreSQL, configuring environment variables, and running both the backend and frontend servers.
